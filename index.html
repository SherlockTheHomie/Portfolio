          <p>This application will blow your mind and leave you speechless. Perhaps I should elaborate on the sheer joy you will experience when opening this application. Much like a cool breeze on a hot summers day, this code refractor will provide a sense of calm and relaxation, the likes of which you've never felt. Turning that cool breeze of recent memory into a violent sneeze. You aren't the violent sneeze type, I know one when I see one and you. Definitely not. Lorem ipsum is cool but isnt this more entertaining for patrons of this somewhat satisfactory website?</p>

          <p>Me describing something I made in detail. Detail with so much description that you understand what I'm talking about and then get confused because your first thought was just contradicted</p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Born on a small island in North Texas, I'm very familiar with island lingo, like, beach, for example. I'd rather not discuss my heritage here though. Perhaps another time, in another life, when we are both cats. The truth is, I've spent so much time trying to make this website do what I want it to do that after reading the instructions/requirements. It doesn't really say that I need to fill this in with an actual about me. So I took the opportunity to fill in enough text for it to look like a small bio about mightself. There, that looks about right. </p>
