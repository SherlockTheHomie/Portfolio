          <h2>Lord of the Quiz</h2>
          <a href="https://sherlockthehomie.github.io/HerfQuiz/"><img src="../Portfolio/assets/images/LordofTheQuiz.png" class="p1" alt="cacaw" id="projects"></a>
          <p>Long ago, there was a city named Jaquery. It's people, known as the Quiz, were searching for peace in a war-torn land ravaged by a troll-like monster named Herf Man. Herf Man was the smartest enemy the Quiz had ever faced. In order to beat him they called upon you to answer their summons and defeat Herf Man, once and for all.</p>
          <p>Lord of the Quiz is an intense RPG written in Javascript that contains none of the elements that would make it logical to consider it an RPG. With 4k graphics, 120FPS and more stuff I'm saying it has but doesn't.</p>
          <p>Answer these well thought out, horrible multiple choice questions before time runs out and rack up a generous score with each correct answer. When your wrong, Herf Man makes sure you know it by yelling at you. Once your game is complete, enter your intials and watch in awe as they save to your local storage and populate the page, because you know you are going to try to beat your high score. High scores are written in stone and will need to be manually deleted if you plan on starting from scratch. However, if you do delete them, Herf Man will return and continue killing the innocent Quiz.</p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Born on a small island in North Texas, I'm very familiar with island lingo, like, beach, for example. I'd rather not discuss my heritage here though. Perhaps another time, in another life, when we are both cats. The truth is, I've spent so much time trying to make this website do what I want it to do that after reading the instructions/requirements. It doesn't really say that I need to fill this in with an actual about me. So I took the opportunity to fill in enough text for it to look like a small bio about mightself. There, that looks about right. </p>
